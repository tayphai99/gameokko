## Profile

He's the sole survivor of the Cervitaurs, protected by his people on the migration path until he was the only one left.

Homeless since childhood, the pain in his heart has prevented him from recognizing true friendship. It was his friends on Mt. Septem who encouraged him to let down his guard. With the evening breezes of the forest, he finally found peace of mind.

Alas, as disasters started to spread in his new home, he saw the tragedies of the old days again. But this time, he decided not to hide anymore.

If the Cervitaurs once llived in the forest, the way to save the land might still be there in his distant holne. And so he embarked on his journey home to seek the ancient legend and to run with his friends again.

He will also fulfill the unfinished wish of his people and, as thelPatron of the Forest, listen to the last echoes of his homeland.
